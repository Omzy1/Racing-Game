# Car racing 3D game built in Unity C#
## A functional Car Racing 3D unity game written in C# that demonstrates how to make a 3D racing car game in Unity which uses an AI controller for the opponent's cars.
The player will be given the choice between Interlagos and Velocity Valley in the main menu's racing game.
By selecting the option Stats in the main menu, the user can additionally view their scoring statistics, including how many races they won and lost, as well as changing their username. 
The user will have two racing-type choices (time trail and race) on each of the two racetracks.
With the time trial race option, players can race alone and attempt to beat their previous best or the set score to win a medal.
While the Race option gives the user the ability to race up to 7 opponents, they may choose how many opponents they want to race as well as how many laps they want to race, which can be up to 12.
When the race is over, a leaderboard with a score and a medal depending on the user's finishing time is shown.
After then, the player can leave the race and return to the main menu.

The project shows how to do the following:
* Creating a simple and effective navigation system.
* Creating animations in the main menu.
* Store scoring data using PlayerPrefs.
* Utilising Special audio effects and Audio effects triggered.
* Creating a map in the game.
* Advanced NPC behavior (AI).
* Creating two racetracks.
